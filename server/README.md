# T06 - Nuxt

This is the implementation of the project using Nuxt

## Preliminary steps
As usual, the first things to do are:
- moving inside the folder with the terminal (or opening the project with VSCode) and then using:

      npm install

- To run the project you have to use:

      npm run dev

    or

      npm run dev -- -o
    
    to automatically open your project in a new tab of your browser.

## Content
The project contains:
- 5 components
  - Card
  - SmallCard
  - TextImage
  - TheFooter
  - TheHeader
- 1 layout: default
- 7 pages reachable at:
  - /
  - /contact
  - /about
  - /dogs
  - /dogs/:id
  - /locations
  - /locations/:id
- The server (also available in a previous repository)

Most of the content is commented to explain how things works.
